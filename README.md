# RevoUIntroProject
Software Engineer Fundamental Course Project

This is a portofolio project, made to fulfill SEFC, and for personal use (it's mobile friendly!). Check the initial design here: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPlqWpK8=/?share_link_id=616778925179
The project is made using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JS. No framework whatsoever. You can make yours too!
